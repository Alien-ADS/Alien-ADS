## Hi there 👋

I'm Alien👽, I'm 19 years old and my main hobby is programing💻.
I'm not an expert for now, but we will see in the future 🔮.
I'm only using AI to learning📖 and gathering informations, not for making code❌!
I'm making programs and other without using AI 🤖 so code won't be the best but if you want you can leave suggestion📝 so I will learn to make code: 
  - that runs faster🏎️
  - improve it📈
  - any other suggestions📮
I will be more than intrested to read them and get better everyday.

I'm currently learning: 
  - cpp 💻
  - java ⛏️
  - Angluar 🅰
  - Unreal Engine 👾
  - Blender 🗿
  - I don't remember others 🙈
